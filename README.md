# About the purpose
This is some implements of the book I am reading named  _Grokking Algorithms_ is by Aditya Bhargava.

## Why I am doing so?
In this book, the code is in python2, since I am more familiar with python3, I want to rebuild all the algorithm it mentioned in that book gradually. I hope I can keep on learning, which is part of the reasons doing so.
